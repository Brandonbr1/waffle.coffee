    <p>The Fabric Loader is a modern, open source, free, and lightweight mod loader for Minecraft since version 1.14. If you use Forge, vanilla, or OptiFine on a day-to-day basis when playing on 1.14+, I would recommend checking out Fabric.</p>
    <p>This is a reference page for links with guides that I have made for Fabric.</p>
    <p>It's worth noting that I believe the future is mostly going to be in <a href=https://quiltmc.org>Quilt</a> modding. However, as it has not yet released, I am going to leave my guides as referencing Fabric instead of Quilt. These guides are meant to be used by everyone, and it would alienate a lot of people by jumping the gun.</p>
